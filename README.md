# AtmosFX Interactive Player

This player is meant to provide interaction with AtmosFX media. The media requires a buffer file as well as the content files. A good example are the Pumpkin Jamboree packages. The player is meant to run on a Raspberry Pi connected to a projector or screen. The interaction comes from either an HTTP API or physical buttons connected to the Raspberry Pi's GPIOs headers.
